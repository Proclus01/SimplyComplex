- Add axes labels and ticks
- Add color picker and/or size (maybe steal from OneNote)
- [MAYBE] Add pop out editor for longer equations
    - Maybe deal in WYSIWYG equation editor? That's asking for a lot though
- [MAYBE] Allow users to enter equations for the input drawing, allowing perfect circles or other function graphs as inputs
- [MAYBE] Allow users to select a few preset input configurations, such as a square, a circle, multiple concentric circles, a grid of lines, etc.
- Remove border on output canvas, make its background slightly darker
- Add border around squiggle currently being drawn
